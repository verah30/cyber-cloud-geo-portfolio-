Day 5 — Exploit-dev, Reverse Shells, C2 Detection & Purple Team

 Wins
- Exploit-dev warmup: created stack overflow PoC on lab binary; obtained controlled EIP overwrite.
- Reverse shell: converted PoC to reverse shell and confirmed listener on Kali.
- C2 detection: wrote Suricata rule to detect shell beacons and an auditd rule to catch nc execution.
- Purple-teamed the chain: exploited -> beacon detected -> host isolated -> playbook executed.


 Reverse shell & C2 mapping
- Listener: nc -lvnp 
- Reverse shell payload used (lab-only)
- Suricata detection: suricata_c2.rule — detects /dev/tcp or typical beacon URI patterns.
