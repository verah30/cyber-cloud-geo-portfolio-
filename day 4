# Day 4 — Lateral Movement, Detection Engineering & Purple Team

 Wins
- Practiced lateral movement in lab: SSH key reuse + controlled SSH hop between lab VMs.
- Built and tested three detections: SSH anomaly (same key used from multiple hosts), process spawn (psexec/winrm), and suspicious scheduled task creation.
- Performed purple-team loop: attack → detect → isolate → harden.

 Artifacts
— ssh_reuse
  — ssh_key_reuse.sigma, suricata_psexec.rule, cloudwatch_cron_modify.txt


Lateral movement notes
  - ssh -i /home/kali/.s... 
  - Reused key demonstrated  

Detections implemented
1. SSH key reuse detection (Sigma): alerts when same key fingerprint used by multiple source IPs within 10 minutes. 
2. Suricata rule for PSExec-like patterns: suricata_psexec.rule.
3. CloudWatch Metric Filter for cron/ scheduled task modifications .
